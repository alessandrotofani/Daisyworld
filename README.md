## Buttons
Buttons are used to setup and direct the simulation.

They should be used in the following order:

1. `clear`: clears the simulation workspace and resets variables values to default;
2. `setup`: sets the environment and creates the agents;
3. `go`: starts the simulation. It is set as continuous (forever), but you can change it by editing the button.

## Sliders
- `albedo_white`: albedo of white daisies;
- `albedo_black`: albedo of black daisies;
- `luminosity`: solar luminosity;
- `n_white`: initial number of white daisies;
- `n_black`: initial number of black daisies.
